# Coinme Smart Device Service

This is the beginning of the project. The idea is to create a piece of software that can run on Google Home devices to query Coinme public data such as "What's the price of BitCoin?"

Stretch Goal: Be able to query personal account data such as "What's my wallet balance?" (Will require login capabilities)
